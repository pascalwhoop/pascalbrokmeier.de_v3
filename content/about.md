I am a {{< age >}} years old digital engineer living in Amsterdam. 
I choose to call myself a digital engineer because it appears to be the best match 
for what I do. I've worked as a Software, Cloud and Data Engineer. 

I'm currently working at Every Cure as Head of Engineering. We are building a platform
to help people with rare diseases by finding existing drugs that can be repurposed for
their disease. Before this, I worked almost 4 years at McKinsey & Company in their Quantum
Black / AI practice. Here, next to the usual client projects, I led the team that made
GenAI available to over 800 technologists within McKinsey, enabling over 100 projects to
use AI in their work.

In the coming 10 years, I want to apply my knowledge of digital systems to
__help us all understand and direct biological systems better__. In my opinion, AI and data driven approaches
will play a crucial role in understanding the complexity of biological systems.


### Background

Academically, my master thesis was on future energy markets, exploring the 
challenges of energy supply in a hopefully sustainable future. My University
degree was a mix between business and computer science. I took the chance of University
to explore classes such as Decision Theory and Evolunionary and Behavior Psychology next to
my main themes. 

After University  I moved to Belgium to work for *Space Applications Services* on an ISS
planning project but quickly switched fields to work as a Data Engineer and Google Cloud
Specialist for *Data Minded*. Finally, I joined McKinsey in late 2020.

### Skills and passions

Looking at tech, I have a broad technical knowledge of a variety of systems. Drop me in
a project that requires numerous systems to talk to each other and work together and I
tend to find my way around and get it to work. Recognising the right people to talk to
and working to keep my team productive is a key component of this.  I am a certified
*Professional Data Engineer and Cloud Architect for the Google Cloud Platform*.  I also
have a bit of a passion for IT privacy and security.  Currently, I mostly work with
__Kubernetes, AWS, terraform and BigData tech like Spark and Kafka__. According to some
colleagues I'm also pretty fun to watch interacting with my shell. Happy to share some
tricks and learn some new ones as well.

From a social perspective, I have volunteered a number of years in the [Erasmus Student
Network](https://esn.org/about), where I was appointed as the National Partnership
Manager for Germany. In winter 19/20 I volunteered at [Hack Your Future
Belgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/) as a coach, teaching web-development and general
SWE skills to refugees. I'd like to get back into this a bit more. 

In my free time I enjoy a number of podcasts and books (see [reading
list](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101578711-pascal-brokmeier)) as well as water and mountain sports and
exploring cities, people and cultures. For the day-to-day, I recently got a road bike
which I enjoy as well.
