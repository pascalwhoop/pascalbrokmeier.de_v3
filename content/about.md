I am a {{< age >}} years old digital engineer living in Brussels, Belgium. 
I choose to call myself a digital engineer because it appears to be the best match 
for what I do. I've worked as a Software, Cloud and Data engineer. I'm currently employed
by McKinsey & Company and I am part of their Quantum Black team. I aim to apply my knowledge
of digital systems which I gained over the last 10 years to learn more about 
biological systems which I want to dedicate my next 10 years to. Thankfully, a lot of
similarities allow for a quick understanding of these fascinating structures.

Before, I worked 6 years in software engineering in Germany and Australia. So far, I have lived
in 5 countries across three continents. That used to be something special but now I meet
people every day who can only smile at that.

Academically, my master thesis was on future energy markets, exploring the 
challenges of energy supply in a hopefully sustainable future. My University
degree was a mix between business and computer science. I took the chance of University
to explore classes such as Decision Theory and Evolunionary and Behavior Psychology next to
my main themes. 

After University  I moved to Belgium to work for
 *Space Applications Services* on
an ISS planning project but quickly switched fields to work as a Data Engineer and
Google Cloud Specialist for *Data Minded*. Finally, I joined McKinsey in late 2020.

Looking at tech, I have a broad technical knowledge of a variety of systems. Drop me in a project
that requires numerous systems to talk to each other and work together and I tend to find 
my way around and get it to work. Recognising the right people to talk to and working 
to keep my team productive is a key component of this.
I am a certified _Professional Data Engineer_ and _Cloud Architect_ for the
Google Cloud Platform.  I also have a bit of
a passion for IT privacy and security.  Currently, I mostly work with Kubernetes, AWS,
terraform and BigData tech like Spark and Kafka. According to some colleagues I'm also
pretty fun to watch interacting with my shell. Happy to share some tricks and learn some new ones
as well.

From a social perspective, I have volunteered a number of years in the [Erasmus Student
Network](https://esn.org/about), where I was appointed as the National Partnership
Manager for Germany. In winter 19/20 I volunteered at [Hack Your Future
Belgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/) as a coach, teaching web-development and general
SWE skills to refugees. I'd like to get back into this a bit more. 

In my free time I enjoy a number of podcasts and books (see [reading
list](http://pascalbrokmeier.de/reading/)) as well as water and mountain sports and
exploring cities, people and cultures. For the day-to-day, I recently got a road bike
which I enjoy as well.
