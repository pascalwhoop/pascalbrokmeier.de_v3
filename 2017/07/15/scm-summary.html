            <p>A summary for the Operations Management course at the University of Cologne in the summer semester of 2017.</p>

<p>This course was separated into two parts. Supply Chain Operations and Behavioral Economics. They were taught by Prof. Thonemann and Prof. Becker-Peth. Most of the graphics are taken from the slide decks of these two professors.</p>

<p><img src="http://pascalbrokmeier.de/images/posts/2017-07-15/20.jpg" alt="" width="1488" height="718" crossorigin="anonymous" /></p>

<p>The Bullwhip effect describes a phenomenon where small fluctuations in the end-customer demand lead to ever-increasing fluctuations of the demand down the supply chain. This is mainly caused by overreaction of individual supply chain participants to small fluctuations in demand.</p>

<p>The effect can be mediated by automated sharing of demand data across the supply chain. However, this is often not implemented due to business reasons. An example would be the non-disclosed amount of Apple watch sales. An alternative is the use of contracts to ensure a minimum and maximum demand per period with additional demand being offered at a higher premium.</p>

<p><strong>Causes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>inadequate information sharing</li>
  <li>lead time and delay of shipments vs. incoming orders</li>
  <li>loss aversion, overreaction</li>
  <li>periodic review inventory model leads to aggregation of orders to large sums</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>\(\alpha\)-service level</strong>: probability that <strong>all demand in an order cycle</strong> is met must be at least
\(\alpha\)
    <ul>
      <li>to calculate the alpha service level, we need to look at the reorder point. If the reorder point is below the expected demand for the lead time plus a safety factor (which is dependent on the ɑ-level), we need to reorder. The reorder amount can still be determined using the iterative solution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>\(\beta\)-service level</strong>: expected fraction that is filled in an order cycle must be at least \(\beta\)
    <ul>
      <li>the β-service level calculations are similar to those of the ɑ. The reorder amount is again determined by the approaches of the continuous review model. The reorder point is similar as with ɑ-level, however we use the inverse loss function instead and the parameter is dependent on \(\sigma\) and \(x^*\).</li>

<p>Barilla was struggling with high variances in their retailer ordering patterns, a typical case of the bullwhip effect. Although the demand for pasta was largely constant with slight but clearly prognosable changes in certain seasons, the overall demand did not fluctuate. However, the three echelon supply chain caused Barilla to observe strong spikes of orders. Additionally, the sales team’s incentives were largely oriented towards overall sales volume and didn’t include avoidance of purchase spikes. Hence, sconti were given to the wholesalers, leading them to perform bulk purchases to make use of the cheaper rates.</p>

<p>Wholesalers expected quick deliveries but Barilla needed to follow a specific production plan to produce the different pasta types in good quality.</p>

<h3 id="two-systems-of-thinking">Two systems of thinking</h3>

<p>The human mind can be modeled as having two systems: The conscious, effortful system that is “single threaded” and requires our attention and the unconscious automatic and heuristics driven system that processes vast amounts of parallel streams of data but can hardly be controlled.</p>

<p><strong>System 1: The conscious stream</strong> follows rules and can adapt to new tasks. It takes control force of will to continually focus on a certain topic without switching to other topics of interest.</p>

<p><img src="http://pascalbrokmeier.de/images/posts/2017-07-15/1.jpg" alt="" width="846" height="656" crossorigin="anonymous" /></p>

<p>The three components of the conscious system describe the state in which the system is and why it needs to be “controlled”. It requires physical, cognitive and emotional effort to steer and direct the <em>train of thought</em>.</p>

<p><strong>System 2: The unconscious processing machine</strong> works with biases, associations, heuristics and is highly parallel. It tries to reduce complex data structures into comprehensible pieces of information that can be analyzed by the conscious stream.</p>

<p>Unfamiliar processes (such as driving a car) can at first require the conscious system to analyze and understand the actions required to perform the tasks. However, the repetitive nature of the activities quickly allow the unconscious system to take over the work.</p>

<h3 id="heuristics-and-biases">Heuristics and Biases</h3>

<p><em>Literature: Kahneman &amp; Tversky (1974): Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases, Science, 185(4157), pp. 1124-1131.</em></p>

<p>Heuristics work by the individual quickly asserting certain structures or patterns based on a limited amount of input data. Often these heuristics are coupled with the need to predict or assert certain characteristics, e.g. a stock price change in the next weeks. There are many automatic rule-sets that most humans follow with their unconscious system which often lead to good results but can also lead to <em>systematic errors</em>.</p>

<h4 id="representative-heuristics">Representative Heuristics</h4>

<p>Choose between A and B, in relation to C. How much is A or B similar to C? The one that is more similar gets chosen. A simple example is “whose kid is this? Dark hair, dark skin, probably Michaels.” This heuristic makes sense in many contexts but can cause issues in others. If one gets a detailed explanation of a persona and then a list of jobs with the task to assign him to the most likely job he will be working in, most people choose the job whose representatives are regarded by culture as similar to the described persona. So a “successful, fit, mathematically interested, technical, adventurous, success driven, academic…” persona when having to select among “cashier, teacher, office clark, astronaut”, most people would choose the last. However, people show an <strong>insensitivity to prior probability of outcomes</strong>. What are the chances that anyone is an astronaut vs. these other very common jobs? Marginal at most. But people associate these descriptions with astronauts so the described persona is representative of the group and therefore considered most likely.</p>

<ul>
  <li>people ignore overall probability of a certain situation being true if</li>
  <li>a description / situation is representative of one of the options even if</li>
  <li>the option is far less likely than all others in the base distribution.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="insensitivity-to-sample-size">insensitivity to sample size</h5>

<p>Even professional Psychologists overestmiate the representative value of small sample sizes for a larger corpus. Overall small sample sizes are more likely to exhibit more extreme values on distribution scales.</p>

<h5 id="misconceptions-of-chance">Misconceptions of chance</h5>

<p>The classic case is the <em>gamblers fallacy</em>. Chance doesn’t self correct, it just dilutes over repetition. Therefore after 5 heads at a coin toss, the next toss is still 50:50, no “it must be tails now”.</p>

<h5 id="insensitivity-to-predictability">Insensitivity to predictability</h5>

<p>Watch 3 couples for 20 minutes each then predict if they will still be together in 5 years from now: Most people would base their predictions on what they observed. But realistically, one knows nothing about the relationships so all predictions should be the same and all should be the average (whatever that is).</p>

<h5 id="illusion-of-validity">Illusion of validity</h5>

<p>People think they are right even though they base their decision on flaky base data. Once they have decided, they stick to their decision with higher confidence than the base information is offering.</p>

<h5 id="misconceptions-of-regression">Misconceptions of Regression</h5>

<p>Generally, there is a regression towards the mean. Although the gamblers fallacy is people expecting this regression, there are also cases in which it is misinterpreted. Let’s imagine students on average achieve a (B-) in school. If a student achieves an A/A+, a teacher will congratulate the student. Yet statistically, the next exam will be more likely to be closer to the average than another good grade again. On the other hand if a student got an F, the teacher will be critical. But statistically, the student will be more likely to get a better grade next time, independent on the criticism or compliments. In both cases, the teacher could in hindsight interpret: “congratulating makes my students write less good exams and criticism fosters good grades”. This would be detrimental to the goals.</p>

<h4 id="availability-bias-and-examples">Availability bias and examples</h4>

<p>Those cases that are easier to recall are usually considered more likely to be true. Examples are</p>

<p>1) Retrievability: The ability to retrieve instances from memory 2) Effectiveness of a search set: Samples of words with r in 1. or 3. letter → 3rd is harder to “search” in the mind, e.g. less likely? false 3) Bias of imaginability: If one cannot imagine something, it is less likely considered to be true</p>

<h4 id="anchoring-and-inadequate-adjustment">Anchoring and inadequate adjustment</h4>

<p>One gets anchored on a number. Examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bargaining on a market place in turkey</li>
  <li>Salary discussions and previous salaries</li>
</ul>

<p>However, even when we are aware of what the anchor is (e.g. an average), we still do not adjust adequately.</p>

<p>Authors: <em>Gary E. Bolton, Elena Katok</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>keeps decision makers from chasing demand and</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the context of the newsvendor model, people have been shown not to behave rationally. This paper seeks to find organizational features that promote optimal behavior.</p>

<p>Previous Research has shown decision makers to show many biases such as the anchoring bias.</p>

<p>The authors performed 3 experiments:</p>

<ol>
  <li>an extended experience with 100 rounds as opposed to 30 rounds in previous research.</li>
  <li>forward-looking learning investigation: They provide the participants with tracking information on forgone and taken decisions to show missed profits and realized profits</li>
  <li>Investigating small-numbers bias: Forcing participants to make standing orders for 10 rounds at a time instead of for each round.</li>
</ol>

<p>The authors find increased experience to help finding the optimal order point. However the Improvements are smaller than they should be. They found <strong>additional information about forgone profits to not lead to significant improvements</strong>. Lastly, making the participants enter <strong>standing orders of 10 rounds each significantly improves the performance</strong>. Generally, <strong>newsvendors do better in high-safety-stock conditions</strong> than in low ones.</p>

<p>A conclusion for organizations is the inhibiting of inappropriate responses to short-term information. This leads to decision makers not letting themselves react to short-term spikes and drops and rather act on a more continuous pattern.</p>

<p>Obviously, the two contracts are of equivalent mathematical value. However, the fixed fee is considered an “extra cost” and triggers loss aversion. In a mathematical sense, the manufacturer would sell his items at retail price \(w=c\), assuming both \(c, p\) are common knowledge in the supply chain. He would then correct this lack of profit by setting a fixed fee \(F = \frac{d*c}{2}\), so half the total profit of the overall supply chain profit. This would, theoretically, lead to the retailer ordering an optimal amount and giving half of its expected profit to the supplier.</p>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p>The optimal channel efficiency (\(\epsilon\)) was never reached. The two-part tariffs actually performed worse than the linear-price contracts (LP) in the overall average. The quantity discount (QT) did improve channel efficiency. It is interesting however, that for if the retailer accepted (A) the contract, the channel efficiency was much higher for both coordinating contracts, that is, the supply chain was successfully coordinated, if the retailer accepted the contracting terms.</p>

<p>\(\epsilon(LP) = 72.95\)
\(\epsilon(TPT) = 69.51\)
\(\epsilon(QD) = 76.37\)
\(\epsilon(LP \mid A) = 77.85\)
\(\epsilon(LP \mid TPT) = 93.62\)</p>

<p>It clearly shows, once the retailer accepts the contract, TPT is much more successful at coordinating the supply chain. The authors also showed that compressing the fix payment, that is hiding the fix payment in the wholesale price, reduces the loss aversion and improves channel coordination.</p>

<p>They also <em>tested for fairness</em> by changing the suppliers payout rate for the real-world payments but kept the retailers rate the same. As such, for each hypothetical dollar, the supplier earned more money than the retailer. However, this did not change the acceptance rate of the contracts offered which the authors interpret as fairness not being a factor in the decision process of the retailer.</p>

  <li>Comparing 3 contracting schemes: Wholesale, buyback and revenue sharing
    <ul>
      <li>buyback and revenue sharing are mathematically equivalent but it is shown that they are not seen as such by subjects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>low/high risk environments lead subjects to prefer one of the two risk-sharing contracts over the other</li>
  <li>learning mediates the effects of irrational behavior</li>
  <li>player playing both sides, both times against/with an algorithm
    <ul>
      <li>approach novel as it removes social preferences</li>

<p>Authors: <em>Becker-Peth, Katok, Thonemann (2013)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Research Question</strong>: How to get contracts designed in a way that the subjects consider behave optimally, i.e. they are coordinating the supply chain</li>
</ul>

<p>To get a better model, the authors include <em>anchoring, loss aversion and mental accounting</em> \(\alpha, \beta\) and \(\gamma\) in the model. They apply this both to the overall corpus of the subjects as well as calculate these variables for each individual to create a individual-based model. They then construct contracts that the model predicts will be more effective with the subjects while also coordinating the supply chain.</p>

<p>Authors: <em>Loch Wu - 2008</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>State of research at point of writing:
    <ul>
      <li>Before Katok, Wu → social preferences effects unknown, most divergence of theoretical performance of contracts and practical performance is attributed to individual behavioral attributes.</li>
      <li>social preferences known from behavioral psychology → transferring concepts to behavioral economics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="experiment-1">Experiment</h4>
<p>The experiment is structured into 3 different conditions: <strong>Control, Relationship and Status</strong>. The control group is neutrally treated, the relationship group are pairs of 2 that are being introduced to each other before beginning the experiment and the status group is confronted with each others total profit after each round to spur competition.</p>

<img src="http://pascalbrokmeier.de/images/posts/2017-07-15/17.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="312" crossorigin="anonymous" /></p>

<p>It becomes clear that the relationship treatment is performing much better than the status treatment. Also, the bump in the first-mover graph shows the reaction of the supplier to its lowering profits and also the realization that he is taking an overproportional part of the margin.</p>

<ul>
  <li>social preferences have an impact</li>
  <li>pricing is more aggressive in a status context</li>
  <li>second mover increases prices when first mover increases prices → economically irrational as it reduces overall profits</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Newsvendor Model</li>
  <li><strong>Order rationioning</strong>: manufacturer forecasts demand and produces according to his own expected demand. If demand is higher than production quantity, each retailer gets a proportionally reduced amount.</li>
  <li><strong>Order batching:</strong> Coordinating multiple retailers by the manufacturer → setting delivery dates so that the overal output is continuous. Compare Barilla case</li>
  <li><strong>Postponement</strong>: Move customization of products for different markets at end of supply chain to avoid complex supply chain structures</li>
  <li><strong>Component commonality</strong>:idea of using standard parts that cost more per piece but reduce complexity. There is a point of equilibrium which equals out the savings in complexity costs for supporting many different variants vs. the increase in unit cost.</li>
  <li>Continuous Review Inventory Model</li>
  <li><strong>Backorder level</strong>: The number of backorders and days where people need to wait. It doesn’t only capture the times when a order cannot be filled but also the time an order has to wait before it gets filled. Can be simulated by having a non-filled order re-request a product in each period until it is being served</li>

  <li><strong>The Wilcoxon signed-rank test</strong> is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test used when comparing two related samples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ (i.e. it is a paired difference test).
    <ul>
      <li>It can be used as an alternative to the paired Student’s t-test, t-test for matched pairs, or the t-test for dependent samples when the population cannot be assumed to be normally distributed.</li>
      <li>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a nonparametric test that can be used to determine whether two dependent samples were selected from populations having the same distribution.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test</strong> is a nonparametric test of the null hypothesis that it is equally likely that a randomly selected value from one sample will be less than or greater than a randomly selected value from a second sample.
    <ul>
      <li>Unlike the t-test it does not require the assumption of normal distributions. It is nearly as efficient as the t-test on normal distributions.</li>
      <li>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a nonparametric test that can be used to determine whether two dependent samples were selected from populations having the same distribution.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Double marginalization</strong>: The effect of two distinct decision makers trying to optimize their individual margins without regarding the fact that their decisions also effect the other decision makers decision.</li>
