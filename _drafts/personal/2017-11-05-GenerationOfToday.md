In a world of aging, wars, corruption and opportunities on a scale that has not been seen before, what do you do if you have your life ahead of you. Yes, I am talking about the generation of us that is both educated enough to see the world for the complex system and mess that it is while at the same time having all the time in the world to probably be able to do anything unless you get run over by a bus. The generation of us that might [see the end of aging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjdpR-TY6QU) as we know it and at the same time is constantly reminded by politicians, news and scientists, that we might not even have a meaningful future because AI is solving all the problems for us.

Sure, it's easy to write a blog post about how to "achieve your goals with five easy steps every day" but how does that help you to find your goal? What if you try meditation (because you were told it helps) and the guided mp3 that you found on some successful app on the AppStore tells you to "visualize your [Sankalpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankalpa)", your deepest desire or goal, but all you got to offer is the desire to have a desire.

## Egoism or altruism

Sure this might sound like a spoiled child of a generation that has everything complaining about all the choices that we are given. And yes, I agree. We are spoiled. I know, because there is enough information on the web that shows just how good we Europeans, or Americans or any other of the rich countries, have it. But the question is fair: As a young, educated academic. What do you aim for? There are enough examples of people on this planet that are so obviously egoistic and self-centered, it is hard to argue not to do the same. Why should you try and do good in a world where some self-centered guy who somehow won an election can just make obsolete the efforts of Millions of others by [pulling out of a hard achieved agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html). Wouldn't it make much more sense to just try to optimize your own happiness with little or no care about others or future generations? Instead of working in a non-profit towards some abstract higher goal that is at the mercy of politicians and companies. But then, if you look at [cultures filled with clever tricksters](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/books/review/the-italians-by-john-hooper.html) you can tell where that leads. On a grand scale, cooperating societies always outperform defecting societies but if you are bound to live in an environment of a high percentage of people using others for their own benefits, what is the point of trying to be a better person?

## What we are told by past generations

When you sit with your grandparents and parents as a young adult what you get told is to "seek your passion", "work hard", "be diligent" or "stick to our values". Now depending on your cultural background, your living ancestors might be more liberal and want you to really be as free as possible or they might be more conservative and really want you to marry, get children and find a good job that you work at until you retire. But the story is the same. They want to you succeed and think they have it all figured out and can now feed their wisdom to you. Yes, in many ways we can learn many things from our parents and grandparents. But which generation has been challenged with the questions we have all at the same time? Let's name a few:

-   With thousands of atomic bombs and more and more states owning them, how much time do we have?
-   Will the classic family structures hold true despite them originating in a world with a 40 +/- 15 years expected life time in times where we might grow much beyond 100 years of age? What do you do, 80 years after you children moved out of the house?
-   With AI progressing at the speed it does today, will there even be work left to do for us when they moved out?
-   Do we have children now, or in 10, 20 or 30 years? Or do we have them at all? We are way too many humans already anyways
-   Where do you settle down if the sea levels rise as much as anticipated? Beachfront property really is a relative term in a span of 40 years.
-   What are the chances we are not either: Killing ourselves in wars, suffering a global pandemic, a super volcano erruption, an asteroid impact or just economic collapse through systematic failure? Sure many of those risks were present since the beginning of civilization but at least most people were oblivious to all these risks.


## Back to the question of goals

So with all these questionable future scenarios, is it really rational to aim for a decent academic education and a solid middle-class job in some large corporation? Or shouldn't we all be living a life like Travis Rice or Keith Richards, really not trying to do anything but enjoy every crazy moment there is? Sure, if some 7.5 Billion people did that, we would by that action itself cause a self-fulfilling prophecy of global collapse but at least we'd have tried to have fun.

A fact is: Our world is more complex than ever. At the same time we are told about all the options and [all the human flaws of thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Thinking_Clearly) and then told to *make the right choices*. We get guides to reach our goals around every corner of the internet but no one tells us what goals to have or where to find them. That is for everyone to decide on their own. But it is harder than ever to do.

Interpret it as you want but some things were certainly easier in the past. Not better, my god no. But easier, that's for sure: When you don't have a choice but taking over your parents business and your dad picks the wife for you, that's two large decisions taken care of. Sure, it's a terrible life when your parents hit you all the time but you have a goal: Get as far away from them as possible once you're 18.

## Just play

Whoever didn't see this coming: When you give a generation of young people an unlimited amount of education, access to information, choices, temptations, parties and problems, all while bombarding them with just as many expectations and challenges, they do not come out of the other side with a structured approach of making everything work out.
We are lost in a world so complex where news aren't true anymore, where [computers can generate real voices and images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsuAQcvafCs), where there are more types of marmelade and fields of study to choose from than fish in the oceans and where every good and bad person in this world is fighting for your attention to advertise, coherce or convince, I wonder how many of us will not just give the middle finger to all of it and just end playing (computer) games until the point comes when also that is taken away [because AI just does it better than us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFr3K2DORc8).
